# Why another webbased library player?
 - Because i can.
 - There wasn't a Symfony based one?
 - The challenge to create one that can handle a big ass collection.
Furthermore:
 - In the future there is going to be a app.
 - Use native flac files for html5 audio.

# The Black Sheep thanks:
 - Koel for the idea.
 - Bootstrap for a nice css framework.
 - Symfony for a nice php framework
 - Materialize and Bootstrap material design for the css tricks
 - Plyr.io for the audio player.
